#  Hello, World! I'm KRISHNA,

🎓 Electronics Engineer by degree  
💻 Tinkerer by habit  
🤖 Debugging life one circuit at a time

Welcome to my GitHub —  a fine collection of Verilog, MATLAB and scripts in Python that (usually) work on the first try… after 37 attempts.

Here you’ll find:
- 🛠️ Projects mixing hardware sparks with software logic
- 🧠 My first steps into the mysterious land of machine learning
- 🚀 Occasional attempts to launch things (in code and otherwise)

When I’m not writing code or wiring things up, I’m probably staring at error messages like they personally offended me.

> “If it works, don’t touch it. If it doesn’t, still don’t touch it... yet.”
