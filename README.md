#  Hello World!
I'm KRISHNA,

🎓 Electronics Engineer by degree.  
🧪 Experimenter by nature.  
🤖 Debugging life, one circuit at a time.

Welcome to my GitHub —  a fine collection of Verilog, MATLAB and scripts in Python that (usually) work on the first try… after 37 attempts.

Here you’ll find:
- 🛠️ Projects mixing hardware sparks with software logic
- 🧠 My first steps into the mysterious land of machine learning
- 🚀 Occasional attempts to launch things (in code and otherwise)



 “Attention is all you need.”
